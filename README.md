## Installation

### Option 1: Copy to Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rshankras/claude-code-apple-skills.git

# Copy skills to your project
mkdir -p your-project/.claude/skills
cp -r claude-code-apple-skills/skills/* your-project/.claude/skills/
```

### Option 2: Global Installation

```bash
# Clone to a permanent location
git clone https://github.com/rshankras/claude-code-apple-skills.git ~/claude-code-apple-skills

# Copy to global Claude config
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r ~/claude-code-apple-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Option 3: Symlink (for active development)

```bash
# Create skills directory if needed
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# Symlink skill categories
ln -s /path/to/claude-code-apple-skills/skills/ios ~/.claude/skills/ios
ln -s /path/to/claude-code-apple-skills/skills/macos ~/.claude/skills/macos
ln -s /path/to/claude-code-apple-skills/skills/product ~/.claude/skills/product
ln -s /path/to/claude-code-apple-skills/skills/release-review ~/.claude/skills/release-review
ln -s /path/to/claude-code-apple-skills/skills/shared ~/.claude/skills/shared
```

## How Skills Are Organized

Each category directory contains a **SKILL.md** entry point that acts as a router to sub-skills:

```
~/.claude/skills/
├── ios/SKILL.md          → Routes to app-planner/, coding-best-practices/, ui-review/
├── macos/SKILL.md        → Routes to 8 sub-skills (SwiftData, Tahoe APIs, etc.)
├── product/SKILL.md      → Routes to 10 product workflow skills
├── release-review/SKILL.md → 6-phase pre-release audit (security, privacy, UX, distribution, API)
└── shared/SKILL.md       → Skill creation templates
```

When you invoke a skill (e.g., `/macos`), Claude:
1. Reads the category's `SKILL.md` entry point
2. Based on your question, reads relevant module files from subdirectories
3. Applies the guidance to your specific context

This modular approach keeps individual files focused while allowing each skill to cover a broad domain.
