# Keyword Optimizer

Optimize app title, subtitle, and keywords for maximum App Store discoverability.

## When to Use

- User is launching a new app
- User wants to improve search rankings
- User asks about ASO (App Store Optimization)
- User is entering new markets/languages

## Information Gathering

Before optimizing, ask about:

1. **App Identity**
   - What does the app do in one sentence?
   - What category is it in?
   - What's the current app name (if exists)?

2. **Target Keywords**
   - What would users search to find this app?
   - What problem words would they use?
   - Any branded terms to include?

3. **Competition**
   - Main competitors?
   - What keywords do they target?
   - Where can you realistically compete?

4. **Goals**
   - Brand awareness vs. category traffic?
   - Specific markets to prioritize?

## Keyword Strategy

### Where Keywords Count

| Field | Limit | Weight | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| **App Name** | 30 chars | Highest | Most valuable real estate |
| **Subtitle** | 30 chars | High | Visible in search, below name |
| **Keywords** | 100 chars | Medium | Not visible to users |
| **Description** | 4000 chars | Low* | *Apple says indexed, debated |

### Keyword Types

1. **Branded** - Your app name, company name
2. **Category** - Generic terms (e.g., "todo app", "weather")
3. **Feature** - Specific functionality (e.g., "offline maps")
4. **Problem** - User pain points (e.g., "forget tasks")
5. **Long-tail** - Specific phrases (e.g., "minimalist habit tracker")

## Optimization Process

### Step 1: Keyword Research

**Generate Initial List:**
```
1. Brainstorm 50+ keywords
2. What would YOU search for this app?
3. Check competitor names/subtitles
4. Use autocomplete suggestions
5. Consider misspellings users make
```

**Research Tools:**
- App Store Search Autocomplete
- AppFollow, Sensor Tower, AppTweak (paid)
- Google Keyword Planner (related terms)
- Competitor subtitle/keyword analysis

### Step 2: Prioritize Keywords

Rate each keyword on:

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Relevance** | Does it accurately describe your app? |
| **Volume** | Do people actually search this? |
| **Difficulty** | Can you realistically rank? |
| **Intent** | Will searchers want your app? |

**Priority Matrix:**
```
High Volume + Low Difficulty = 🎯 Target First
High Volume + High Difficulty = 💪 Long-term Goal
Low Volume + Low Difficulty = ✅ Easy Wins
Low Volume + High Difficulty = ❌ Skip
```

### Step 3: Allocate Keywords

**App Name (30 characters):**
```
[Brand Name] - [Top Keyword Phrase]
or
[Brand Name]: [Value Proposition]

Examples:
"Notion - Notes & Docs"
"Calm: Sleep & Meditation"
"Fantastical - Calendar & Tasks"
```

**Subtitle (30 characters):**
```
[Second Priority Keywords] / [Unique Value]

Examples:
"Focus Timer & Daily Planner"
"Simple Habit Building"
"Weather Radar & Forecasts"
```

**Keywords Field (100 characters):**
```
Rules:
- Comma-separated, NO spaces after commas
- No plurals (Apple handles it)
- No duplicates from name/subtitle
- No category name (already indexed)
- Single words perform better than phrases

Example:
"timer,pomodoro,focus,concentration,study,productivity,work,session,break,technique"
```

## Character Optimization

### Maximize 100 Characters

**Bad (wastes characters):**
```
task manager, todo list, productivity app, reminder app, checklist
```

**Good (efficient):**
```
task,todo,productivity,reminder,checklist,planner,organize,gtd,schedule,daily
```

**Savings:**
- Remove spaces after commas
- Don't repeat words in different forms
- Skip obvious words (app, free, best)

### Word Combinations

Apple combines words from all fields:

```
Name: "Focus Timer"
Subtitle: "Pomodoro Technique"
Keywords: "study,productivity,work,session"

Searchable combinations:
- "focus timer"
- "pomodoro timer"
- "focus productivity"
- "study timer"
- "work focus"
(and more...)
```

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Don't Do This:**
- Using spaces after commas in keywords
- Duplicating words across fields
- Including your category name
- Using competitor brand names
- Adding "app" or "application"
- Including "free" (filterable separately)
- Using special characters or emoji
- Repeating singular/plural forms

✅ **Do This:**
- Research before guessing
- Prioritize relevance over volume
- Update keywords quarterly
- Track ranking changes
- Localize keywords per market
